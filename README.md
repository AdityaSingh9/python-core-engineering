# Python Core Engineering

A deep dive into Python as an engineering language — focused on writing production-grade, scalable, and maintainable systems.
This repository is designed to build strong foundations required for backend systems, distributed applications, and integration platforms. Python is treated here not as a scripting tool, but as a systems engineering language.

---

## Objective

The goal of this repository is to:

* Master Python beyond syntax
* Understand internal behavior and execution models
* Design reusable, scalable components
* Apply clean architecture principles
* Build production-ready foundations for backend and integration systems

This serves as a long-term reference implementation for professional Python engineering practices.

---

## Scope

### 1. Core Language Foundations

* Advanced data structures usage
* Object-Oriented Programming (composition, inheritance)
* SOLID principles
* Functional programming concepts
* Type hints and static typing
* Custom exception hierarchies
* Structured logging patterns

---

### 2. Advanced Engineering Concepts

* Decorators and higher-order functions
* Generators and iterators
* Context managers (sync and async)
* Dependency Injection patterns
* Middleware design patterns
* Application lifecycle management

---

### 3. Concurrency & Parallelism

* Threading
* Multiprocessing
* Understanding the GIL
* I/O-bound vs CPU-bound workloads
* Async vs Sync execution
* asyncio event loop internals
* Async context managers
* Task scheduling and performance considerations

---

### 4. Performance & Profiling

* cProfile usage
* Memory profiling basics
* Benchmarking techniques
* Optimization strategies
* Identifying bottlenecks

---

### 5. Testing & Code Quality

* Unit testing with pytest
* Fixtures and mocking
* Test structure best practices
* Code coverage measurement
* Designing testable systems

---

### 6. Packaging & Distribution

* Professional project structure
* `pyproject.toml`
* Dependency management
* Versioning strategies (semantic versioning)
* Building reusable internal packages

## Engineering Philosophy

This repository prioritizes:

* Clean, readable code
* Strong architecture over shortcuts
* Reusability and modularity
* Scalability readiness
* Production mindset from day one

The concepts here serve as the foundation for:

* FastAPI / Flask applications
* Microservices architectures
* Event-driven systems
* Integration platforms
* AI-enabled backend systems

---

## Long-Term Vision

This project is part of a larger roadmap toward:

* Backend Architecture Mastery
* API Platform Engineering
* Distributed Systems Design
* Intelligent Integration Systems

Python is the core engine behind all of it.
